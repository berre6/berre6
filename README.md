 Hi I'm Berre üëæ
  A passionate computer engineer student üñ•Ô∏è
I have hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, building a solid foundation in web development, and have worked with C programming, which strengthened my understanding of computer science fundamentals such as memory management, algorithms, and data structures. Currently, I am expanding my skills in Python, SQL and C# working on projects that involve automation and data management.
